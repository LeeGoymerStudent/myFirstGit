## My First(ish) GitHub Repository
-----

This project contains the script as required by Task 3 of the Week 2 workshop of the Web Programming course. More importantly, this project is evidence of my having completed the activities pertaining to the workshop.

The script included in this project simply prints **"hello world"** to the console.

The only installation necessary is ensuring you have **Node** installed. Provided this is the case, to run the script simply run the command `node main.js` in a node-enabled command terminal.
